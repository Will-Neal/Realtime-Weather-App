# Realtime-Weather-App

## Description

The weather dashboard is a real time weather application that takes user input fort the city and then displays both the weather for the day in that city as well as a five day forecast. The application displays the temperature, Wind Speed and Humidity along with the date and an icon representing the weather conditions. The day forecast for the city also displays the UV index for the day with a color coded background indicating weather the UV level is low, moderate or severe. When the user searches for a city it is saved and a button is created to search for that city again if they choose to do so.
